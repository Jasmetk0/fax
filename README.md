## Admin Woorld calendar popup
Any admin form field ending in `_date` automatically gains a Woorld calendar button.
Dates are entered as `DD-MM-YYYY` and stored as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
The popup uses the canonical calendar core (V1/V2 + proto-V3) with Mondayâ€“Sunday
weekdays and dynamic month lengths. Setting `request.session['woorld_today']`
allows the "Today" button to jump to the current Woorld date.

## MSA greenfield (in-place)

- Removed legacy tournament/match logic and related services.
- Retains integration with `fax_calendar` date widgets.
- Provides fresh `Country`, `Player`, and `Tournament` models with simple list/detail/create pages.
- **Breaking change:** existing databases must be reset for development/testing; production migrations will arrive later.
